## Installation

```bash
yarn add phosphor-react
```

or

```bash
npm install --save phosphor-react
```

## Usage

Simply import the icons you need, and add them anywhere in your render method. Phosphor supports tree-shaking, so your bundle only includes code for the icons you use.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Horse, Heart, Cube } from "phosphor-react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Horse />
      <Heart color="#AE2983" weight="fill" size={32} />
      <Cube color="teal" weight="duotone" />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Props

Icon components accept all props that you can pass to a normal SVG element, including inline `style` objects, `onClick` handlers, and more. The main way of styling them will usually be with the following props:

- **color?**: `string` – Icon stroke/fill color. Can be any CSS color string, including `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, named colors, or the special `currentColor` variable.
- **size?**: `number | string` – Icon height & width. As with standard React elements, this can be a number, or a string with units in `px`, `%`, `em`, `rem`, `pt`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`.
- **weight?**: `"thin" | "light" | "regular" | "bold" | "fill" | "duotone"` – Icon weight/style. Can also be used, for example, to "toggle" an icon's state: a rating component could use Stars with `weight="regular"` to denote an empty star, and `weight="fill"` to denote a filled star.
- **mirrored?**: `boolean` – Flip the icon horizontally. Can be useful in RTL languages where normal icon orientation is not appropriate.
- **alt?**: `string` – Add accessible alt text to an icon.

### Context

Phosphor takes advantage of React Context to make applying a default style to all icons simple. Create an `IconContext.Provider` at the root of the app (or anywhere above the icons in the tree) and pass in a configuration object with props to be applied by default to all icons:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { IconContext, Horse, Heart, Cube } from "phosphor-react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <IconContext.Provider
      value={{
        color: "limegreen",
        size: 32,
        weight: "bold",
        mirrored: false,
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <Horse /> {/* I'm lime-green, 32px, and bold! */}
        <Heart /> {/* Me too! */}
        <Cube />  {/* Me three :) */}
      </div>
    </IconContext.Provider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

You may create multiple Contexts for styling icons differently in separate regions of an application; icons use the nearest Context above them to determine their style.

> **Note:** The context will also pass any provided SVG props down to icon instances, which can be useful E.G. in adding accessible `aria-label`s, `classNames`, etc.

### Composability

<img src="/meta/cube-rotate.svg" width="128" align="right" />

Components can accept arbitrary SVG elements as children, so long as they are valid children of the `<svg>` element. This can be used to modify an icon with background layers or shapes, filters, animations and more. The children will be placed *below* the normal icon contents.

The following will cause the Cube icon to rotate and pulse:

```jsx
const RotatingCube = () => {
  return (
    <Cube color="darkorchid" weight="duotone">
      <animate
        attributeName="opacity"
        values="0;1;0"
        dur="4s"
        repeatCount="indefinite"
      ></animate>
      <animateTransform
        attributeName="transform"
        attributeType="XML"
        type="rotate"
        dur="5s"
        from="0 0 0"
        to="360 0 0"
        repeatCount="indefinite"
      ></animateTransform>
    </Cube>
  );
};
```

> **Note:** The coordinate space of slotted elements is relative to the contents of the icon `viewBox`, which is a 256x256 square. Only [valid SVG elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element#SVG_elements_by_category) will be rendered.

### Imports

You may wish to import all icons at once for use in your project, though depending on your bundler this could prevent tree-shaking and make your app's bundle larger.

```tsx
import * as Icon from "phosphor-react";
...
<Icon.Smiley />
<Icon.Folder weight="thin" />
<Icon.BatteryHalf size="24px" />
```
